# My LLM Prompts

This repository contains useful system and user LLM prompts that I wrote for myself. The prompts are generally applicable to any LLM.

Promts are arranged according to the size of the models. If a prompt works with smaller models, it should also perform well with larger ones.

MDPs rely on varables such as the environment, agent’s actions, and rewards to decide the system’s next optimal action. They are classified into four types — finite infinite, continuous, or discrete — depending on various fators such as sets of actions, available states, and the decision-making frequency.

Let's consider first sentience "MDPs rely on varables such as the environment, agent’s actions, and rewards to decide the system’s next optimal action."

I see a mistake in the word, "varables" should be a "variables". The rest of the sentience looks right.

Next we review the "They are classified into four types — finite infinite, continuous, or discrete — depending on various fators such as sets of actions, available states, and the decision-making frequency."

I see a mistake in the word "fators", it must be "factors", right? Also, there is a missing comma between the words "finite infinite", it should be "finite, infinite, ...".

Taking everything into account, 

### corrected text:

The core idea of information theory is that the "informational alue" of a communicated message depends on the degre to which the content of the message is surprising. If a highly likely event occurs, the message carries very little information. On the other hand, if a highly unlikely event occurs, the message is much more. For instance, the knowledge that some particular number will not be the wining number of a lottery provides very little information, because any particular chosen number will almost certainly not win. However, knowledge that a particular number will win a lottery has high informational value because it communicates the occurrence of a very low probability event.

<answer>
Let's consider the first sentence: "The core idea of information theory is that the 'informational alue' of a communicated message depends on the degre to which the content of the message is surprising."  

I see two spelling mistakes:  
- "alue" should be "value".  
- "degre" should be "degree".  

Next sentence: "If a highly likely event occurs, the message carries very little information."  

This sentence looks correct!  

Next sentence:  
"On the other hand, if a highly unlikely event occurs, the message is much more."  

There is an issue at the end—"the message is much more" is incomplete. It should be something like "the message carries much more informative."  

Next sentence: "For instance, the knowledge that some particular number will not be the wining number of a lottery provides very little information, because any particular chosen number will almost certainly not win."

I see a spelling mistake:  
- "wining" should be "winning".  

Last sentence:  
"However, knowledge that a particular number will win a lottery has high informational value because it communicates the occurrence of a very low probability event."

This sentence is correct!
